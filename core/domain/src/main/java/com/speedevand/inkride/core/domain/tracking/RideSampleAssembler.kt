/**
 * Fuses one cycle's raw GPS/barometer/heading readings into a

 * per distinct [RawGpsFix.fixTimeMs] — [assemble] is called far more often
 * than GPS produces new fixes (barometer ~2Hz, heading on every ~2° step),
 * and a fix stays usable for a few seconds after it arrives; without this
 * dedup guard the filter would run a full predict+update cycle multiple
 * times per second against an unchanged position, dragging its velocity
 * estimate toward zero and over-shrinking its covariance between real fixes.
 *
 * Bearing prefers GPS course-over-ground when moving fast enough to trust it
 * over the smoothed magnetometer/rotation-vector heading (which is easily
 * disturbed by a bike frame and the phone's own fields at low speed), falling
 * back to the heading otherwise. Whichever source is chosen is sanitized:
 * non-finite values are dropped, finite ones normalized into `[0, 360)`.
