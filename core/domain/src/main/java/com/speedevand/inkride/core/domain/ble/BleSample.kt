 * cumulative count from a CSC sensor, exposed for completeness; [cadenceRpm] is
 * the derived crank cadence most riders care about. [connected] is true while at
 * least one paired device has a live GATT connection; it flips to false (with
 * the readings cleared) as soon as a sensor drops, so stale values never linger.
